<h2>Our 2 Monthaversary! 🎉</h2>
<p>
hi my baby, i can’t believe it’s already been 2 months with you woaaahh. it still feels unreal to me how we randomly met and then boom we clicked instantly awh my baby☹️☹️ every single moment with you has been pure magic. you’ve made me live through all those movie love stories without me even having to ask for it, and honestly that’s the kind of love i’ll never get tired of, the kind that just happens naturally. i love you eo much i could seriously hug you forever and ever without letting go. over time you’ve become my favorite person, the only one i can trust with every part of me, which again CRAZY because i never thought i’d ever love or trust someone this much omg, and yet here i am in a relationship with the bestest person ever, and i honestly couldn’t ask for anyone or anything better than you. 

you’re always so affectionate with me and you never fail to make me feel loved, whether it’s through your tiny gestures, your drawings of my favorite flowers when you can’t give them to me irl, your letters and paragraphs every night, your reminders of how much you love me every day, or the way you make me feel like i’m the perfectest person ever. i can’t even pick a favorite way because they’re all so precious in ways words just can’t capture. you’re the love of my life, the one i want to love again and again for the rest of my life. normally i get tired of loving people, but with you i feel like even the love i have in me isn’t even close to how much i love you. our love is so deep that even the connection of our souls can’t compare. you’re my forever, my one and only, and if it isn’t you it’s no one, and that’s exactly how i want it to stay.

and baby, i don’t say this enough, or at least not nearly as much as it should be said, but thank you for being you, for making me laugh until my cheeks hurt, for caring for me so deeply, and for loving me so effortlessly. sometimes i just sit there and think, no way this man is my boyfriend, like seriously pinky promise on everything baby you’re so perfect that it always shocks me. i’m the luckiest woman on earth to have someone like you by my side, loving me more and more every single day, even when we fight over who loves who more 😡😡😡

i’m so excited for everything we’ll share in the future. woahh summer you can’t forget summer HELLYEWH, just imagine how much we will end up kissing eachother every 3 seconds or tje 2 rounds woaaahh. okay but baby especially our kids awh i can’t wait for us to be parents because i promise you that you’ll be the bestest dad there is, just like you are the bestest boyfriend and future husband. i can already see us laughing so hard at bedtime stories that we made up for our kids, or building forts in the living room, or even baking together with you throwing flour at my face, and maybe one day explaining to our kids why their dad can’t physically say no to their mom because he loves her too much. here’s to many more months together myhearttt, many many months filled with chaos love laughter and all the little things that make us, well us.

i love you so much, always and forever.💗

    <h2>When You Miss Me</h2>
   <p>  If you’re missing me nownownow then that honestly makes my heart ache in the bestest way ever because It means what we have is real enough to be felt when we’re apart. It means I matter to you and that’s means the whole world to me. woaaah i matter to my boyfriend YAYAYAYYAYA AWHHH MY BABYY 

But don’t let missing me turn scary i promise ill be back oky. 😡😡 but baby a teenie weenie reminder that I’m not someone temporary or halfway here. I didn’t choose you by accident, and I’m not staying by coincidence. I chose you because I wanted to. and I will continue choosing you until my very last breath okay☹️☹️

baby the best thing is that our distance doesn’t ruin our relationship and if anything it makes us stronger and  thats what i love most about it. its probably the only thing i like about our distance BOOOO☹️☹️☹️☹️but baby even if we’re not talking in that exact second, I still carry you with me in small ways throughout my day. So if the space feels loud, just remember I’m still here. im always always here woaaah i could be under your bed or in your closet WOAAAHH watch out baby im not going anywhere.

    <h2>When You Have a Bad Day</h2>
    <p>  awh hi my poor babyy well im not sad now but when you open this youll either be having a bad day or you just opened this for fun but either way mylove bad days don’t cancel out who you are and they don’t erase any of your progress, effort, or your growth. sometimes the world is just exhausting and unfair and a big fat meanie thats meaner than it needs to be. and it’s okay if today felt like that

youre allowed to have bad days. and you’re allowed to feel disappointed or frustrated. but never ever let one hard day rewrite anything okay. you’re still super duper capable of everything and more. still growing and becoming everything you’re meant to be even if it doesn’t feel obvious right now.

and baby tomorrow is always a clean page to restart because you deserve a fresh start.  no matter how today went, I’m still proud of you for trying. youre my baby and i promise to stay by your side no matter whattt MWAAAAHH IM KISS ATTACKING YOU </p>

<div id="mad" class="letter-page">
    <h2>When You're Mad</h2>
<p> hii myheartt i know when you’re angry everything feels more intense than it probably is. your thoughts move faster and more impulsive and it’s like everything becomes bigger than it needs to be. I’m not here to act like your feelings aren’t valid but baby i want you to know that i think that
you’re such a good person, and I hate the idea of something small ruining your whole mood. but baby woaaah deep breaths okay you don’t have to respond immediately and you don’t have to fix everything now okay YAYAYYAYA calm okay baby 

I love the way youre always so calm about everything regardless of how bad or big the thing is. even if you get a bit frustrated i know it still comes from your heart. and to me thats the cutest thing ever also baby youre softer than you pretend to be, and that softness is something I’ll always cherish and protect . and no matter what happens I’m still by your side.
<br>
now, i want you to act towards this situation with the same calmness you treat me with because nothings ever ever worth your anger or irritation. i love you so much my precious boyyy </p>

    <h2>When You're Sad</h2>
    <p> HI MY BABYYY If you’re reading this then I’m guessing today you feel booohoohoo or maybe again youre just opening this for fun but anyways mylove sometimes youre sad  for no clear reason but it just feels like too much. I wish I could sit next to you and hug you and kiss attack you with the biggest fattest kisses right now just to help you feel better but i cant

but baby you don’t need to explain yourself to anyone if you dont feel like it and you don’t need to act strong ay all. I KNOW O SAY RHIS ALOT but I care about you on your quiet days too but like especially on those days. youre not a burden for feeling things EVER EVER OKAY DONT EVEN THINK THAT OMG but baby youre human duh and everyone feels things like this and as your girlfriend its my collective responsibility to make sure youre doing amazing ( that was a fancy sentence) but baby just because youre with me that doesnr make everything amazing and i totally understand that so baby anytime you remember some things or feel a certain way towards anything im always here to listen and help you, i made these letters as a reminder that you can always come back to me regardless of the situation and that youll never ever ever EVERRR be a burden to me no matter what youre feeling or how stressful it is. one more thing, I love everything about you even when it makes you seem vulnerable.

Whatever you’re feeling right now won’t last forever. feelings move even when they feel stuck. (not your feelings for me okay.) and even if it takes time, I’m not going anywhere. you don’t scare me away when you’re sad. you matter to me in every version of yourself the nonchalant one the tired one the quiet one the funny one and basically just all of you.

    <h2>When You Can't Sleep</h2>
    <p> hi my sleepy babyyy i know deep down youre sleepy. I JUST DO MY GIRLFRIEND INSTINCT IS KICKING IN. your mind probably won’t stop racing but come sit here with me for a second or imagine it atleast.I know how it feels when your brain just won’t switch off replaying conversations in a good or bad way hmm orr maybeee eve imagining worst case scenarios( god forbid.) orr thinking about tomorrow before it even arrives.

but you don’t need to solve tomorrow tonight. you don’t need to carry the whole future at idk what time. let your shoulders drop. unclench your jaw. Slow your breathing. Inhale slowly. exhale longer relax your face especially your eyebrows aand boom do it again.

baby you probably need this sleep okay so hmm Imagine I’m next to you, wnd we’re cuddling baby and hmmmmm just talking quietly about nothing important i want yoi to know that you deserve peace and everything good in the world. WE DONT WANT YOUR CAKE TO HAVE CHEMICALS AGWIN BABY. so as for now your only responsibility is to sleep. I hope you drift off knowing you’re cared for and loved so very deeply </p>

THEN we breathe okay.

youre loved.
youre everything ive ever wanted.
and I am by your side always and forever.

    <h2>The One I never ever say enough</h2>
    <p> This is the part where I tell you the things I don’t always say out loud but even if i do, to me they’re never too much to say

okay baby i made this to remind you that i love you alot but if you actually ever end up forgetting how much i love you then woahhh ive failed as a girlfriend. BUT THATS NOT YOUR FAULT OKAY If you ever start doubting how much you mean to me read this very slowly wnd memorize it like that german poem you memorized in february. I don’t love you in a temporary way. I love you so much even in the moments where you question everything. in the way I think about you randomly during my day, in the way small things remind me of you, in the way I notice details about you that no one else does.

I love the way you think. the way you care. the way you try, even when you’re unsure. youre not just someone I like being around. youre someone i wanna spend the rest of my life with, someone I genuinely value. someone I respect. someone I chose wholeheartedly.

and all of that doesn’t fade because of one bad mood, one bad thought, or one rough season. my feelings for you aren’t fragile theyre steady. and i feel like ive said all of this in my valentines paragraph but its the full truth coming right from the center and very bottom of my heart. so baby. if your mind ever tells you otherwise, don’t believe it. okay maybe sometimes i act stupid or especially stubborn but that doesnt make loving you any less. its probably more NONO definitely more because i dont think there has ever been a passing day where ive loved you the same or less.

you always do these little things that make my day in some way or another and its the things like those that make me fall harder and harder for you. and just know baby youre the only thing on this earth that calms me and keeps me sane. idk how you do it bur you do it in a way so well that IDK ILL EXPLODE NOW. you get me so well you ARE the perfect person for me and i believe that if we were ever words in some other universe we would be those words that complete each other like soul and mate because there has never been a split second where my heart hasn’t felt complete with you around. AWWHHH but yes baby youre the love of my life and id choose you even if our memories of eachother now were erased ( GOD FORBID.) because even if my mind weren’t to recognize you my soul always will and thats the most important part ever.

i hope this helped you even a bit but if it didn’t baby then id recommend you reading my valentines paragraph again because thats the closest ive ever felt to projecting my feelings for you okay my precious babyy☹️☹️
